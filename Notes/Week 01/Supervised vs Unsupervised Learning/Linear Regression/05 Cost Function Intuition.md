# Cost Function Intuition

The goal:

minimize $J(w,b)$

One thing you can do is to simplify the cost function equation by removing $b$ (bias).

Taking just one part of the simplified equation we get

$f_w(x)$ on one side and 

$J(w)$ on the other. 

Looking more closely at our model, we can imagine that $w$ is fixed. Let's call it zero. 

So our model becomes a function of $x$. $y$ will change whenever $x$ does.

One the other side, we can see that our cost function $j$ is a function of $w$. So the cost defined by $j$ depends on the $w$ parameter.
