# Linear Regression Model Part 01

A linear regression model fits a straight line to your data. It is likely the most used ML model in the world.

In a simple x,y graph, a linear regression model will find a straight line that shows the trend of the data. It could be useful for something like finding the asking price of a house based on its location and square footage.

Linear Regression is a type of supervised learning model because you give it labeled data. 

Remember, regression models predict numbers from an infinite range of possibilties. This contrasts with classification models, which predict a number from a limited set.

Linear Regression models can also produce a data table, which shows the same data in what might be a more convenient way. The data table just shows x on the left and y on the right.

## Terminology

Training Set: The data used to train the model. 

x: the common notation for the input variable

y: the common notation for the output or "target" variable.

m: the number of training samples

(x,y): a single training example

(x^i^, y^i^): the i^th^ training example. Note, this is not exponentiation. It's just the index number or row of the training set.
