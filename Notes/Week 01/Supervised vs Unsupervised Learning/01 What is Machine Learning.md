## What is Machine Learning?

* A field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

## Types of Machine Learning

* Supervised Learning
* Unsupervised Learning

Of those two, supervised learning is used most often the in the real world.

Other types include Recommender Systems and Reinforcement learning.

This course focuses on practical advice for *applying* learning algorithms. 

It's not just about having the tools, it's about learning how to use them.
