# Unsupervised Learning Part 01

After supervised learning, the most-used type of machine learning is unsupervised learning. 

In unsupervised learning, no labels are given for any data. For example, in a data model meant to find cancerous tumors, no labels are given to the computer to identify a mass as benign or malignant. 

Without these labels, the computer cannot explicitly identify a malignant tumor, but that isn't the goal of unsupervised learning. Instead, the model is meant to find interesting patterns in the data. 

Since humans are not superivising the algorithm, we have unsupervised learning.

The goal is not a certain output. It is to let the computer find patterns.

The algorithm might decide that the data can be sorted into clusters based on these patterns. This is called a **clustering algorithm**. 

Clustering algorithms are used in news feed recommendations. This can help group articles about a certain subject together. Useful unless you want to have humans dig through hundreds of thousands of articles each day to group them.

Another use for a clustering algorithm is in analyzing DNA. 

Unsupervised learning does not have a "right" answer. Again, it's just about finding patterns.
