# Supervised Learning Part 02

Supervised Learning algorithms match x to y. Input to output.

## Classification

One example of classification problem is cancer detection. The algorithm uses the patient's medical records to try and figure out if a mass is malignant or benign. 

Classification is different from regression because while regression can answer with just about any number, classification algorithms have a limited set of outputs. In the cancer example, we're looking for one of two outputs: malignant or not.

Hot dog or not hot dog, right? That's classification.

A more complex algorithm might have more output types. For example, predicting the type of cancer. 

Classification algorithms predict *classes* or *categories*. The terms are interchangable. 

It is possible to use n number of inputs in an effort to get an accurate output. 

For example, in the cancer app certain factors about the patient, such as age, can affect the output.

In reality, many inputs are used in cancer identification.

But those are the two types of supervised learning: **Regression** and **Classification**.
