# Supervised Learning Part 01

Ng estimates that 99% of the economic value derived from ML is via supervised learning.

Supervised learning relies of feeding a machine correct answers. This teaches the computer how to identify the features it is looking for.

Examples: spam filtering, speech recognition, machine translation, online advertising.

Online advertising relies on a combination of you (the user) and the ad itself.

Ads are the biggest economic driver of AI.

Other examples: manufacturing quality control (visual inspection) and self-driving cars. 

The patten is input (x) and output (y).

The goal is to be able to give an *unknown* x and still get the correct output.

One type of supervised learning is **regression**. In regression, you try to predict a number based on n number of inputs, with n usually being very large.

Another type is **classification** but that is for part 2.
