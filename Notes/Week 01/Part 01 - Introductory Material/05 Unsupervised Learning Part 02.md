# Unsupervised Learning Part 02

## A More Formal Definition of Unsupervised Learning

Data only comes with inputs x, but not outputs y. The algorithm has to find **structure** in the data.

In addition to clustering, another use for unsupervised learning is **anomaly detection**. This finds unusal data points that don't match known patterns. Great for fraud detection.

A third use is **dimensionality reduction**, which compresses data using fewer numbers.
