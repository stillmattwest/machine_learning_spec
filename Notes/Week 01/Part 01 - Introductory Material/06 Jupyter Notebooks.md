# Jupyter Notebooks

The most widely used tool by data scientists and ML engineers today is Jupyter Notebooks.

In this course there are optional labs. These labs are designed to be easy and there's no code to write. You just run it line by line and see how it works. 

These are ungraded but sound like a good idea. Ng recommends them.

Practice labs require writing code. None of these in week 01.

The blocks in a JN are either markdown or code. The blocks are more properly called *cells*. 

shift+enter will reveal the raw markdown code in those cells. It will also run code in the code cells.
