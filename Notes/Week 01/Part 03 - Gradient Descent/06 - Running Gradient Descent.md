# Running Gradient Descent

Applying gradient descent against all the training data at each step is called **batch gradient descent**. 

Deep Learning AI actually has a newsletter called "The Batch." 

Next Up: The optional labs. This is where you get to put your hands on this formula and see it work. 

Do the Jupyter Notebook, but also consider trying to make this work locally using NumPy and MathPlotLib.
