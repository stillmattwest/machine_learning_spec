# Gradient Descent Intuition

Our gradient descent formulae:

$w = w - \alpha \frac{\partial}{\partial w}J(w,b)$

and

$b = b - \alpha \frac{\partial}{\partial b}J(w,b)$

Note: $\partial$ is not the same as $d$. $d$ is a variable but $\partial$ is the symbol for a *partial derivative*, which is just called a derivative at this point in the course.
