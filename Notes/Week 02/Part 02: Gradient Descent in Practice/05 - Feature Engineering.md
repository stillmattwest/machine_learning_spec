# Feature Engineering

The choice of features can have a huge impact on your algorithm's performance.

A feature is something you want to train your model on. One of the x inputs.

In the class, Ng gives an example of a house with features describing lot depth and lot frontage. Instead of using these, Ng suggests multiplying the two features and getting an area feature, which a human might find more important in determining house price.

That creation of a new feature from existing features is one example of feature engineering and developers can use that to better train their models. 

But there is a type of feature engineering that allows models to fit their predictions to non-linear data. More on that in the next section.
